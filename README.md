2021 Capstone GA Grades Map Web Application
1.	Schoolgrades API needs to be figured out. I keep getting CORS policy errors. If unable to be fixed we might have to make our own API or find another way to use the data through the files. I have made a JSON file with all of the data or we have a CVS file depending on whats easiest. we HAVE to figure this out before anything else can get done. 
2.	School districts need to be taken and outlined on the map with googles API and Schoolgrades API.  I have Georgia outlined with the shape.geojson file. In order to add the outline the file MUST be geojson and follow the google API requirements.
3.	A function to put all of the schools on the map with markers and a list of those schools on the side needs to be made. This would use both APIs.
4.	All of the search bars and buttons to change search settings need to gain functionality. 
5.	When you click on a school everything needs to disappear and all of the school information needs to pop up in an organized matter. This will use mainly the School Grades API and Javascript mustache. That page still needs to be built out. This one will take a long time. 
6.	The aesthetics of the page need a make over and new styling. It needs a new color set, button look, and logo redesign. It needs to look good and be professional. This will have to be done for both pages. The Map and The  School Details.
